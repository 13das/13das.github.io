Personal Profile
======
First-class Computer Science Masters graduate with proven industry experience and a strong academic foundation in
machine learning, computer vision, and systems design. My work spans interactive STEM education tools, geospatial data processing, and real-time augmented reality applications and often involves full-stack development with technologies such as AWS, Unity, Python, and React. Comfortable in agile teams and adept at presenting technical solutions to diverse audiences,  I  bring  initiative,  adaptability,  and  a  deep  enthusiasm  for  tackling  complex  challenges.  I'm  now  seeking opportunities  where  I  can  contribute  meaningfully  to  innovative  engineering  projects  while  continuing  to  grow  as  a developer and problem-solver.
